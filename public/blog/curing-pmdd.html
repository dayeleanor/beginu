            <p>
               
Consistently for the past two years, I have been tracking the symptoms of severe anxiety, panic attacks and depression occurring eleven days or so up until the start of my period. Whilst I am not formally diagnosed with PMDD, both I and my mother exhibited the textbook symptoms of feeling an intense sense of dread, misery and desperation prior to our periods occurring. 


            </p>
		   <p>
               Alongside the psychological symptoms, I would often experience fevers, increased appetite and severe nightmares. All of these symptoms occurred consistently in the run-up to my period and were tracked with this helpful app.
            </p>
		   <p>
               Through a process of trial and error, I have significantly improved my experience of the symptoms of PMDD to the point that I am not needing to engage in talk therapy anymore and I decided to write this article due to me being in “hell week” currently and being in the best mood for at least two years since I started tracking my symptoms.
            </p>
		  
		   <p>
               For full disclosure, as well as having suspected PMDD, I am formally diagnosed as Autistic and I was recently confirmed as having PCOS in August 2021. After I initially started taking Metformin to handle my PCOS I noticed that my PMDD symptoms increased in severity. As Metformin is associated with a decrease in the absorption of vitamin B12 I wondered if my other B levels were also being lowered and causing even more intense mood swings. Due to the cost of going private to be diagnosed with PCOS (as the NHS scan didn’t spot any of the many cysts I had) I haven’t been in a rush to get formally diagnosed with PMDD.
            </p>
		   <p>
               In terms of contraception, I have recently started taking Cerazette and I've noticed a flattening of my ruminating behaviours and fixating on old stressors. I've seen very mixed feedback on a number of PMDD support threads about the minipill but I think it could be worth trialling if you are currently suffering. I have also seen another review previously where this same birth control was also shown to help a fellow PMDD sufferer.


            </p>
		   <p>I take the following supplements just after the date that I expect ovulation has occurred up until the start of my period. 
               
            </p>
		   <p>Raspberry Leaf - 3000mg

Vitex (Chasteberry/Agnus Castus) - 4mg

No Flush Niacin - 500mg

Calcium with vitamin D - 600mg

Up to 10g of Inositol powder (it is far cheaper to buy the powder in bulk than the capsules)

Health & Her Premenstrual Multi-Nutrient Support with includes all of the following:

Vitamin B6 - 1.4 mg	

Vitamin B5 - 12 mg

Magnesium - 57 mg	

Iron - 7 mg

Agnus Castus - 80 mg	

Ashwagandha - 250 mg	

Dandelion - 200 mg	

Flaxseed - 200 mg	

Ginger extract - 1,000 mg
               
            </p>
		   <p>Fingers crossed if you are reading this article that these recommended supplements can also help you, out of all of these, inositol, high dose raspberry leaf and the premenstrual multi-nutrient support have improved my overall happiness significantly. I think that the effects of raspberry leaf wear off after around twelve hours, so splitting out my dose has helped maintain the benefits all day.


In terms of things that didn’t work as well that are often recommended, many different brands of antihistamines had the effects wear off after a few months and taking red maca made me very angry.
