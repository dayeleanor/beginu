              Inositol, also known as inositol hexaphosphate, IP6, or Vitamin B8, is a vitamin supplement that presents a wide range of benefits. Inositol is considered a sugar alcohol with a structure similar to glucose, both of which occur naturally within the human body. IP6 can also be found in plants, animals, or manufactured within a laboratory. Inositol comes in powder form and is available for purchase at most vitamin or health food stores. 
            </p>
              <p>
               The main function of inositol is to assist in the transmission of impulses and signals between cell membranes and cell nuclei. When the body does not have enough inositol, signals between the membranes and nuclei cannot be completed. As a result, certain processes in the body may be impaired. In addition, one of inositol’s key roles is helping with the removal of fat from the liver.
            </p>
		   <p>The list of applications for inositol is lengthy. Most notable is the use in helping to fight high cholesterol and nerve impairments. Assorted neurological disorders can also be treated with inositol, such as panic attacks, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), depression, autism, and schizophrenia. Other testing reveals that inositol may have some positive effect on the treatment of diabetes, polycystic ovary syndrome, hair growth and restoration, insomnia, and ADHD (Attention Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder).
               
            </p>
		   <p>Inositol is currently being studied for its potential to treat cancer. While the current body of research is relatively premature, early findings seem to show that inositol can halt the spread of cancerous tumors. In addition, inositol may aid in limiting tumor size. Test findings show that inositol has played a part in keeping cancer from reaching the nucleus of infected cells. In turn, this causes the cell to die and halts the cancer’s progress.
               
            </p>
		   <p>Not only might inositol be a direct factor in battling cancer, but recent studies have suggested that inositol may play a complementary role in conventional cancer treatment. Traditional cancer drugs and programs such as chemotherapy have been found to have a greater effect when performed at the same time that inositol is prescribed. If these findings prove conclusive, inositol may help reduce both the length and intensity of standard cancer treatment routines.
               
            </p>
		   <p>While the human body produces inositol naturally, it can also fail to keep an adequate supply. This leads to an inositol deficiency. Inositol deficiencies can create unwelcome side effects when left untreated. Symptoms can include hair loss, skin rashes or blotches, and constipation. Memory loss is another significant consequence of inositol deficiency as the absence of IP6 can lead to the inability of neurological signals to be transmitted between cells.
               
            </p>
		   <p>Low inositol levels are often traced back to a few standard causes. Most notable is the use of antibiotics. People who are prescribed antibiotic medications for extended periods of time are at higher risk of inositol deficiency than those who consume antibiotics infrequently. Moderate to high coffee intake also appears to have an adverse effect on the body’s supply of inositol. For those with IP6 deficiency, coffee intake should be reduced until a personal care provider determines that inositol levels have returned to satisfactory levels.
               
            </p>
		   <p>Because inositol occurs naturally within the body, people who take inositol as a supplement typically do not experience any side effects. In the event that an IP6 user consumes too much supplemental inositol, however, side effects may be observed. These can include, but are not limited to, diarrhea, bloating, excessive flatulence, headaches, and nausea. To avoid possible complications from inositol supplementation, users are advised to seek a doctor’s recommendation regarding usage.
               
            </p>
		   <p>

In conclusion, inositol has already proven to be beneficial for many people experiencing a vitamin deficiency. IP6 also holds a lot of promise for prevention of disease and treatment of existing ailments. With increased testing, inositol may even prove to be a lifesaver.
