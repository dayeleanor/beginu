             If you have PCOS, (also known as polycystic ovarian syndrome), then your doctor may have advised you to lose weight. However, this is easier said than done. PCOS disrupts natural hormone patterns and can often encourage weight gain, which in turn can worsen your symptoms.   
            </p>
            <p>
             Fortunately, you can use appropriate nutrition to counteract these negative effects and get to an appropriate weight for you.  
            </p>
		  
            <p>
		Eat Fewer Carbs

Carbs aren't bad in and of themselves, and you need some, but people with PCOS generally benefit from scaling back their intake. This is largely because the hormonal disruption of PCOS encourages insulin resistance, which thrives on sugar.




To help keep your insulin levels under control, eliminate or cut down on the amount of processed sugar and refined grains you eat. While you don't need to wreck your mental health by never eating another cupcake, saving sweets for holidays or other rare occasions will improve your nutrition and help you lose belly fat.




Next, make sure that the grains you do eat are whole. In addition to having more vitamins and minerals, grains like whole-wheat bread contain fibre that will help balance your blood sugar.   </p>
		    <p>Balance Your Meals

Another way to improve your blood sugar and decrease your insulin resistance is by balancing your meals. Opt for foods low on the glycemic index when you can, and avoid meals that contain only carbs or other quickly digested substances. For example, you'll want to avoid eating only toast for breakfast, since bread has a high glycemic value. Likewise, if you eat a potato, which your body can digest rapidly, you'll want to pair it with healthy fats, lean protein, and fiber, such as a side of broccoli and a salmon filet drizzled with olive oil, so that your blood sugar doesn't spike.
                
            </p>
            <p>
              Focus on Quality Instead of Quantity

While traditional weight-loss advice is to restrict calories, doing so with PCOS isn't the best idea. Certainly, you don't want to overeat, but undereating may not help either.




Because of the hormonal irregularities PCOS causes, weight loss is often a long-term effort for people with the condition. And long-term calorie restriction can slow down your metabolism, making weight loss still more difficult.




Instead of going on a diet, focus on the quality of your food. Eat whole foods, including fruit and an abundance of vegetables. Reduce your consumption of simple carbohydrates that break down quickly. As these nutritional measures help balance your hormones, your body will be in a better position to lose weight naturally -- while maintaining your metabolism. 
            </p>
		  
            <p>Fight Inflammation

Another common problem in people with chronic conditions, including PCOS, is inflammation. To counteract this problem, choose anti-inflammatory foods, such as leafy greens, fatty fish, and berries.




For example, you may want to start your morning with a green smoothie, combining berries and leafy greens such as spinach or kale for a nutritious breakfast. Include a banana to mask the taste of the greens. For a more balanced meal, add a protein like peanut or almond butter to the mixture. Milk can also be a good addition for added protein, calcium, and healthy fat.




Losing weight with PCOS is difficult, but it's possible. To do so, focus less on your weight and more on your overall health. By eating balanced, nutritious meals and decreasing your carb intake, you can reap the benefits of positive nutrition and prime your body to reach its ideal weight.
